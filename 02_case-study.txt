Based on the described situation, the project must have been using a waterfall methodology as it was mentoined that it was "meticulously planned." Due to experience, it might have been too ambitious or not suffieciently planned. The objectives, scope, roles and responsibilities should be clear, for example using a RACI Chart/Matrix. Another solution would be to plan for risk management, because every project would have to take some risks or uncertainties and that's where Agile Methodology comes in, agile can be very effective in managing issues and bugs because of it's regular cermonies like daily stand-ups. 

Let alone, the testing delays should've been communicated well by the development team, agile can help manage communication issues as it will reflect to the progress of every iteration.
