Case Study #1


Reflecting on your experience, what lessons have you learned, and what actionable steps can you take to prevent similar issues in the future?

As the professional role is not specified specifically, assuming that I am the project manager of the project team assigned to the software solution project, having an agile mindset I have to adapt and take action to the changes that occurred. I will set high priority in planning a change management plan and a risk management plan that will prevent similar issues in the future. 

Otherwise, assuming I am a developer of the software solution, understanding the third-party dependencies and considering long-term support to third party solution providers in choosing them.
